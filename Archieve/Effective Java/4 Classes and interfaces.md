---

### Item 15: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members
### Item 16: In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields
### Item 17: Minimize mutability
### Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance
### Item 19: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it
### Item 20: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes
### Item 21: Design interfaces for posterity
### Item 22: Use interfaces only to define types
### Item 23: Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes
### Item 24: Favor static member classes over nonstatic

A **nested class** is a class defined within another class. There are four kinds of nested classes:

* static member classes
* nonstatic member classes
* anonymous classes
* local classes

All but the first kind are known as **inner classes**.
